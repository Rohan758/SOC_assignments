# SOC_assignments
This GitHub repo contain assignments from my "SoC'24 [ Project ID: 102 ] : Gesture based text creation aka Virtual Notepad and recognition" project. 

The project started with basics of python language and libraries like numpy, pandas, etc. Than we were introduced to concepts of machine learning and deep learning. The main focus of this project was towards convolutional neural networks (CNN), understanding and implementing it. I used mnist datasets to train my character recognition model and than integrated it with the final script which resulted in such a mode which can take live hand drawn characters (on webcam feed itself) as input through webcam and and predict the drawn character and display it in the screen.
